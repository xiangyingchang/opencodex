# Transports And Sidecars SOT

## Provider diagnostic outbound safety

Provider connection tests and live model discovery share the GET-only provider outbound wrapper.
Direct HTTP(S) resolves once and pins the validated address; HTTPS preserves the original Host/SNI
and always verifies certificates. Proxy-configured requests stay on Bun fetch so HTTP(S)_PROXY,
ALL_PROXY, and NO_PROXY semantics remain authoritative. The wrapper classifies successful local DNS answers, but
only a typed DNS-resolution failure degrades to proxy resolution; every literal, metadata, and
resolved-address policy error still rejects. Proxy mode logs once that the proxy-selected peer
cannot be pinned. Private destinations additionally require allowPrivateNetwork plus NO_PROXY.

Both paths reject redirects and expose only credential-stripped final-address guidance. This phase
does not cover ordinary requests, streaming, retries, or per-hop redirect review on those paths.
Caller-owned `provider.fetch` executors are also deferred: they receive literal/config checks and
redirect blocking, but cannot inherit DNS classification or peer pinning without a verified-peer
executor contract. Main-request migration must not treat that branch as fixed-transport equivalent.

## Responses HTTP/SSE

`/v1/responses` is the main Codex-facing endpoint. The server parses Responses input, routes to a
provider, lets the selected adapter speak the upstream protocol, then bridges adapter events back to
Responses-compatible streaming output.

The option-aware `openai` provider uses `openai-responses` with `authMode: "forward"`. Pool mode
resolves main plus added accounts through affinity/quota/cooldown ownership; Direct forwards only
the allowed Codex/OpenAI auth/session headers from the current request and short-circuits pool
state. `openai-apikey` uses its configured key and canonical API base URL. Missing credentials fail
within their route; neither route falls through to the other. See
[`08_openai-provider-tiers.md`](08_openai-provider-tiers.md).

`POST /v1/responses/compact` handles remote compaction v1 before the generic `/v1/responses` branch
and before the `/v1/*` guard. Unknown `/v1/*` paths return JSON 404 errors instead of falling through
to GUI static serving.

### Passthrough SSE stream shapes (#314)

Native passthrough SSE has TWO shapes, selected per request in
`src/server/responses/core.ts`:

- **Default outside Windows: tee + background inspection.** `upstreamResponse.body.tee()` sends
  branch[0] through a terminal-aware client relay while branch[1] is
  drained eagerly by `consumeForInspection`/`consumeForResponseLogMetadata`
  for terminal-outcome recording, quota, the passthrough continuation cache,
  and request logs. This remains the default shape on bundled Bun 1.3.14.
- **Terminal-aware eager bounded relay** (`src/server/relay-eager.ts`). Windows
  uses this single-reader shape for rewrite traffic and for no-rewrite traffic
  selected by `selectEagerPath` in `src/lib/bun-stream-caps.ts`; the latter keeps
  `legacy-tee` and known-bad-runtime `auto` on tee as documented. When selected,
  `response.completed` closes the client stream even if upstream keeps HTTP/SSE
  alive. Darwin uses it for no-client-rewrite traffic only (neither image-gen
  aliases nor item-id repair) and is explicit-only: `auto` stays tee even after
  a future threshold bump. One eager reader + byte-bounded
  client queue + post-cancel bounded discard-drain replaces the tee and goes
  directly to the response without a JS rewrite wrapper, preserving the full
  inspection side-effect set (shared `createSseInspector` factory in `relay.ts`)
  including the #44 late-terminal semantics.

The two-shape contract is mirror-commented in `src/server/index.ts`; the real
`core.ts` gate is source-invariant-tested by `tests/passthrough-abort.test.ts`,
and the platform matrix lives in `tests/bun-stream-caps.test.ts`. Keep all three
in lockstep with any passthrough-policy change.

## Standalone Search and exact account selectors

`POST /v1/alpha/search` retains the selected model in its request body. When that value is an
account-qualified native selector, the server resolves the public namespace, uses only the mapped
stored Codex credential, and sends the bare native model upstream. That exact path is fail-closed:
it does not consult Pool active state or affinity when selecting, and its outcomes cannot rotate
the active Pool account. An account-wide credential failure still quarantines that credential and
clears stale ordinary Pool affinities so they cannot reappear after reauthentication. Quota and
transient outcomes from an exact request leave Pool affinities untouched. Ordinary search requests
keep the normal Direct/Pool sidecar behavior.

Standalone Images and Live requests currently carry neither the account-qualified model selector
nor a trustworthy thread correlation from the Codex client. They therefore retain normal provider
routing. Do not infer an exact account from caller-supplied account headers, process-global last
selection, connection identity, or other ambient state; concurrent threads could cross-route
credentials. Extending exact routing to those endpoints requires an opaque client correlation that
can be bound server-side to a previously validated selector.

## Standalone Images

Codex's local `image_gen.imagegen` tool makes a second Images request after the model calls it:
`POST /v1/images/generations` for generation or `POST /v1/images/edits` for reference-image edits.
These are standalone Images API routes, not the hosted Responses `image_generation` tool.

`src/server/images.ts` uses the existing ChatGPT/OpenAI fallback unless `images.provider` explicitly
selects a custom API-key `openai-responses` provider. Explicit selection fails closed when the
provider is missing, disabled, registry-managed, incompatible, or lacks a usable key; it never
falls through to another paid upstream. The relay accepts bounded JSON generation and edit requests,
then forwards the decoded JSON without rewriting Codex's edit schema. Each paid Images POST receives
one upstream attempt; client cancellation aborts the upstream and pool-only failures update the
existing account-health state. Unknown Images subpaths still reach the JSON `/v1/*` 404 guard.

When the OpenAI credential path is unavailable or its authentication fails, `generations` (not
`edits`) may fall back to Google Antigravity if that provider is logged in. The fallback is
credential-driven: it exists so an image request reaches a real upstream answer rather than dying on a
local credential error, and it does not apply when the caller selected an explicit keyed custom
provider, because a configured pool owns its own authentication failure rather than hiding it behind
separately billed generation.

On non-loopback binds, data-plane authentication and origin policy cover both Images routes. An
explicit keyed Images provider accepts the proxy admission secret as either an OpenAI-style bearer
or `x-opencodex-api-key` because the provider key replaces caller authorization before fetch. The
ChatGPT forward path still requires the dedicated header so its upstream bearer remains distinct.

The API-key `openai-responses` path also adapts Codex's private standalone image tool to the public
Responses tool surface. A complete `image_gen` namespace is lowered to safe
`image_gen__<inner-name>` function aliases even when no hosted image tool is present, because public
Responses runtimes may reserve the namespace itself and reject dotted function names. Native and
legacy dotted calls replayed in `body.input` are encoded to the same aliases. When any client
image-gen declaration is replaced by a usable `image_gen__<inner-name>` alias, the adapter also drops
hosted `image_generation` and deduplicates aliases in stable container order. Empty or malformed
namespaces do not remove the hosted fallback. Discovery and normalization span both top-level
`body.tools` and Codex Desktop Responses Lite `input[].type = "additional_tools"` containers.

For a model explicitly listed in `modelPreferHostedTools`, a non-forward Responses provider may opt
to remove colliding client `image_gen` declarations before this normalization and rewrite their
selectors to hosted `image_generation`, so a provider-reserved hosted tool takes precedence without
loosening a caller's tool-choice restriction. The opt-in is intentionally model-scoped: the default
alias path remains safest for ordinary public Responses endpoints.

For OpenAI API virtual `-pro` models, preference lookup checks the selected public ID first and
uses the resolved base wire-model ID as a fallback. `modelAdapters` resolves the public ID first and
the base ID second; the second pass selects the final adapter, and configuration validation mirrors
both steps.

Client-facing API-key responses perform the inverse mapping: JSON output and SSE function-call
items restore `{ namespace: "image_gen", name: "<inner-name>" }` so Codex can dispatch the local
extension. When item-id repair is also enabled, both transforms compose in one SSE parse/stringify
pass (`src/server/sse-payload-rewrite.ts`) rather than chaining separate JS pull wrappers.
Inspection and continuation-cache branches keep the raw upstream alias, allowing stored
replays to return upstream without leaking a client-only namespace shape. Malformed, empty, and
unrelated namespaces remain untouched. ChatGPT forward mode preserves the private namespace and
hosted tool because that backend understands their native semantics.

Per-model `modelReasoningSummaryDelivery` is a narrow compatibility layer for
`openai-responses` gateways whose summary capability is real but whose accepted delivery enum
differs from Codex. Presence advertises reasoning summaries in the routed catalog and rewrites only
an already-present `stream_options.reasoning_summary_delivery` at the adapter boundary. It never
injects summary generation into a request, and config validation rejects a delivery map that
conflicts with `modelSupportsReasoningSummaries: false` for the same model.

[Decision Log]
- 목적과 의도: Preserve Codex Desktop reasoning summaries while adapting only the delivery enum rejected by a specific Responses-compatible upstream.
- 기존 구현 및 제약 조건: The existing boolean capability either passed Codex's enum unchanged or disabled summaries entirely; stale running clients can keep sending the old enum after a catalog refresh.
- 검토한 주요 대안: Disable summaries; rewrite the enum globally; inject a delivery field when absent; configure a provider-wide value.
- 선택한 방식: Use a validated per-model allowlisted map, imply summary capability for that model, and rewrite only a caller-provided delivery field at the Responses adapter boundary.
- 다른 대안 대신 이 방식을 선택한 이유: Upstream enum support differs by model and provider, while global rewriting or injection would change unrelated requests and disabling summaries removes Desktop UX.
- 장점, 단점 및 영향: Configured models retain the native summary UI and stale clients self-heal; each incompatible model needs an explicit map entry and contradictory opt-out configuration now fails closed.

## Claude Desktop config-library resolution

The Desktop profile writer and the management status probe share
`resolveDesktop3pConfigLibraryPath`. The resolver reproduces Desktop's own rule rather than a guess:
an explicit `CLAUDE_USER_DATA_DIR` (or the opencodex override) wins; on Windows
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Claude-3p` wins; otherwise the Electron user-data path gains a `-3p` suffix if it
does not already have one. `configLibrary` is appended to that root.

`Claude-3p` is Desktop's real directory name, assembled at runtime from `"Claude" + "-3p"`, which is
why searching the app bundle for the literal string finds nothing. It is not a legacy path to migrate
away from. Resolution stays a pure function of (env, platform, home) so the Windows branch is
testable on any host: stubbing `process.platform` does not propagate to `os.platform()` under Bun.

[Decision Log]
- 목적과 의도: 생성된 Claude Desktop 프로필이 설치된 Desktop이 실제로 읽는 디렉터리에 떨어지고, 대시보드 상태가 그 쓰기 대상과 일치하게 한다.
- 기존 구현 및 제약 조건: 두 호출자가 경로 계산을 각자 복제했고, Desktop이 실제로 참조하는 `CLAUDE_USER_DATA_DIR`와 Windows `LOCALAPPDATA` 분기가 빠져 있었다(#539). 사용자가 프로필 루트를 직접 지정하는 경우도 있다.
- 검토한 주요 대안: `-3p` 접미사를 구버전 잔재로 보고 제거; 두 디렉터리를 모두 스캔; 레거시 파일을 자동 이전; 크로스플랫폼 해석기를 한 곳에 둔다.
- 선택한 방식: Desktop 번들의 해석 규칙을 그대로 이식한 override 인지 해석기를 한 곳에 두고, 쓰기 경로와 상태 조회가 같은 함수를 쓴다.
- 다른 대안 대신 이 방식을 선택한 이유: `-3p`는 Desktop의 정상 동작이므로 제거는 회귀였다. 해석기를 한 곳에 두면 두 호출자의 드리프트가 불가능해지고, 파괴적 이전 없이 상태와 쓰기 대상이 일치한다.
- 장점, 단점 및 영향: 지원 플랫폼 전부에서 apply 결과가 Desktop에 보인다. 비표준 레이아웃 사용자는 문서화된 override를 써야 하고, 해석기는 Desktop 번들의 규칙 변경을 따라가야 한다.

## Cursor Native Exec

Cursor's experimental live transport can receive server-driven local read/write/delete/ls/grep,
shell, and fetch exec frames. These frames are denied by default because they bypass Codex's normal
approval and sandbox path. `nativeLocalExec: "on"` is the explicit config-owner opt-in for trusted
local experiments; `off` and the backwards-compatible `codex-sandbox` spelling both fail closed.
MCP, screen recording, and computer-use stay on their separate explicit executor/MCP config paths.

[Decision Log]
- 목적과 의도: prevent caller-controlled Responses text from authorizing Cursor native local shell, filesystem, or fetch execution.
- 기존 구현 및 제약 조건: the adapter preserved top-level `instructions`, system messages, and developer messages, then treated a `sandbox_mode ... danger-full-access` prose marker as an exec allow signal in `codex-sandbox` mode.
- 검토한 주요 대안: keep marker-based authorization, require a future trustworthy attestation channel, or restrict authorization to server-local config.
- 선택한 방식: keep marker detection only as diagnostic/context and make `nativeLocalExec: "on"` the only non-legacy mode that enables built-in local exec; unset, `off`, and `codex-sandbox` all deny.
- 다른 대안 대신 이 방식을 선택한 이유: opencodex has no trustworthy per-request sandbox attestation in request text or headers, so any prompt-carried marker is spoofable by data-plane callers.
- 장점, 단점 및 영향: this closes prompt-to-native-exec escalation while preserving an explicit operator escape hatch; existing configs that relied on `codex-sandbox` must switch to `nativeLocalExec: "on"` for trusted local experiments.

## WebSocket

The WebSocket endpoint exists at `/v1/responses`, but discovery is opt-in:

```json
{
  "websockets": false
}
```

`websocketsEnabled(config)` is true only for an explicit `true`. When false, opencodex removes
`supports_websockets` from injected provider tables and routed catalog entries, keeping Codex on
HTTP/SSE. When true, Codex may use Responses WebSocket frames handled by `src/server/ws-bridge.ts`.
If Codex still attempts a WebSocket upgrade while the feature is disabled, `/v1/responses` rejects
the upgrade with 426 so Codex falls back to HTTP cleanly.

The endpoint handles `response.create`, ignores `response.processed`, supports warmup
`generate: false`, and feeds the same request pipeline as HTTP/SSE.

Registry-declared per-model compatibility hints (`modelResponsesUpstreamStreaming`) may ask the
upstream Responses endpoint for bounded JSON on ANY client transport — WebSocket or ordinary
HTTP/SSE. The bridge reframes that JSON into the same Responses event sequence
(`src/server/responses-json-events.ts`): WS turns send the frames as WebSocket messages, while
HTTP clients that requested streaming receive a synthesized terminal SSE body (created →
output_item.done → terminal → `[DONE]`). DeepSeek V4 Flash uses this path because its Codex
streaming response can deliver output without closing on a terminal event.

`ws-bridge.ts` preserves upstream `failed` and `incomplete` status values in the final WebSocket
frame rather than always emitting `response.completed`. If the response status is `failed`, a
`response.failed` frame is sent; otherwise `response.completed` carries through the original status.

## Heartbeat and stall deadline

The HTTP/SSE bridge emits `response.heartbeat` events during upstream silence to re-arm Codex's idle
timer (Codex's default `stream_idle_timeout` is 300 s and ANY SSE event re-arms it). Those
bridge-enqueued keepalive frames do NOT count as activity for the bridge's own watchdog: a bounded
stall deadline (default 300 s, configurable via `stallTimeoutSec`, checked on the 2 s heartbeat tick)
closes the stream with `response.incomplete` / `upstream_stall_timeout` and cancels the upstream
request if no real adapter events arrive. Adapter-yielded `{ type: "heartbeat" }` events DO reset
the watchdog.

The web-search loop requests `stream: true` for every routed-model iteration, but buffers the events
needed to decide whether to intercept a synthetic search call. Text explicitly phased as
`commentary` is safe to forward live because it cannot terminate the turn; this keeps Kiro's
progress visible. A Kiro stream EOF after user-facing text or reasoning gets one bounded completion
retry, because neither the upstream text event nor `END_TURN` / `STOP_SEQUENCE` reliably distinguishes
progress from a final answer. Those two clean-stop reasons prove only that the inference ended; on a
tool-enabled turn, only the private completion tool authorizes `final_answer`. Any other explicit
reason already terminated the inference upstream and is reported as a terminal state rather
than converted into another model request: output-token limits become continuable incomplete output,
context-window exhaustion becomes a non-retryable `context_length_exceeded` error, filtering becomes
filtered incomplete output, and a `TOOL_USE` without an actual tool call is a contradiction. Since
the stop reason arrives only at the end of the stream, `required`-mode assistant text is held inside
the adapter until a real tool call starts or the stream ends, then released as `commentary` unless a
private completion call supplied the final answer. Each held event yields a `heartbeat` in its place
so the stall watchdog stays armed. Synthetic search calls, real tool calls,
and terminal events remain buffered until the iteration validates. Only the first iteration's final
response headers/status and any 429 key rotations are handled eagerly. A failure before downstream
SSE starts returns non-2xx JSON; once headers have started the final response, a generation failure
is emitted as `response.failed` SSE.

Kiro transient HTTP 429 recovery is coordinated process-wide after the first throttle: healthy
traffic remains parallel, but throttled followers wait behind one abort-aware probe and share a
deadline that is re-checked after every sleep. Event-stream `ThrottlingException` records the same
deadline for the next client replay. Retries are bounded to three attempts; hard quota responses and
ordinary 5xx errors are not replayed. Completion fallback rebuilds only replayable text, preserves
the original user/tool-result turn for reasoning-only attempts, supplies neutral non-empty carriers
for empty tool output, and validates role alternation plus tool-use/result pairing before transport.

Provider-level `retryOn429` (devlog 260802_429_same_target_retry) is the generic, opt-in
same-target 429 retry for API-key providers (`authMode: "key"`), primarily single-key pools
that cannot use multi-key failover. In the pre-stream recovery loop, a 429 waits (`Retry-After`
or the fixed interval, capped at `maxIntervalMs`) and replays the identical request on the same
key before any failover, up to `attempts` extra times per request (the budget lives outside the
recovery loop, so a 413/401 replay cannot re-arm it). The same wait-and-replay applies to every
other key-auth surface that bypasses that loop: the Responses passthrough wire (e.g. the
built-in DeepSeek preset), the image/video bridge and web-search sidecar loops (before their
`on429` key rotation), and Anthropic terminal-guard continuations (before key/account
failover). The policy covers HTTP-capable adapters only: custom `runTurn` transports in the
image loop run through an event queue and never receive an HTTP status, so they are outside
the HTTP retry scope and cannot replay a 429. Codex never retries 429 client-side (openai/codex#30471), so this is the only
defense for those providers; the final 429 still carries `Retry-After` for clients that honor
it. Concurrent requests each honor their own policy — there is no process-wide shared cooldown
(unlike the Kiro pattern), so a rate-limit storm multiplies upstream volume by at most
`attempts + poolKeys` per request (same-key replays, then failover keys; the pool size is the
operator-configured `apiKeyPool` length, fixed for the duration of the request). Every surface
releases (and awaits the cancellation of) the unread 429 body before the backoff, records the
`rate-limit-429` recovery kind on replay sends, and the bridge loops clear the old
response-header deadline before the wait and start a fresh one afterward — client cancellation
is re-checked after the wait, so 499 always wins over a stale-deadline edge, and backoffs never
consume the connect budget or surface as a 504. The wait is abort-aware:
once the server observes the client disconnect (Bun propagates it asynchronously, observed
1–10 s), the sleep is interrupted, the unread 429 body is released, and the request is
cancelled with 499 before any replay; because the propagation is async, a replay may precede
the cancel if the interval elapses first (bounded by the same `attempts` budget).

[Decision Log]
- 목적과 의도: Prevent Kiro progress from becoming a false final answer, reject invalid empty completion retries, and stop concurrent transient 429s from consuming independent retry budgets.
- 기존 구현 및 제약 조건: Kiro text has no trustworthy phase; stop metadata arrives only at stream end; the private completion tool is adapter-owned; normal parallel tool traffic must remain parallel; client cancellation must interrupt all waits.
- 검토한 주요 대안: Trust native `END_TURN`; infer completion from wording; serialize every Kiro request; leave throttling entirely to the client; manufacture empty assistant turns to preserve alternation.
- 선택한 방식: Require the private completion tool on tool-enabled turns, rebuild only valid replayable wire turns, validate the final conversation, and activate a shared cooldown plus single probe only after a transient throttle.
- 다른 대안 대신 이 방식을 선택한 이유: Native stop metadata has mislabeled progress, wording is language-dependent, global serialization harms healthy concurrency, client-only retries amplify bursts, and empty structural turns are rejected upstream.
- 장점, 단점 및 영향: Completion phase is deterministic and throttled concurrency recovers without a request storm; some clean Kiro stops pay one bounded validation call and an exactly repeated completion answer may be shown twice to preserve `final_answer` semantics.

Historical `web_search_call` output items from previous Responses turns are not converted into
assistant text. They are UI/search-cell evidence, not a replayable search result payload; turning
them into strings risks routed models echoing an internal marker or implying a current search ran
when the sidecar is unavailable. The active sidecar path is the only place that emits new
`web_search_call_begin` / `web_search_call_end` events.

Four independent clocks bound this path. `stallTimeoutSec` is the base bridge event-stall budget.
`connectTimeoutMs` (default 200 s) covers only DNS/TCP/TLS and the wait for final response headers,
not response-body generation. Config-file-only
`webSearchSidecar.routedModelStallTimeoutMs` (default 200 s, integer 1..2147483647) bounds continuous
raw response-byte inactivity for a routed-model iteration and resets on every non-empty byte.
`webSearchSidecar.timeoutMs` (default 60 s) separately bounds one hosted search request (lowered
from 200 s so an unavailable/limit-exhausted search backend degrades within ~1 min instead of
hanging the whole turn, #398). The
effective web-search bridge watchdog is
`max(base stall, connect timeout, routed-model stall, sidecar timeout) + 30 s` (230 s at defaults,
dominated by the routed-model stall clock),
with seam heartbeats between bounded units. None of these clocks is a total generation deadline.

## Reasoning and tool-result compatibility

Native OpenAI passthrough sanitizes routed reasoning history so `reasoning` input items do not send
non-empty `content` arrays to upstream models that reject them. Chat Completions bridging repairs
orphan `toolResult` messages by inserting a synthetic assistant `tool_call` before tool messages.
It also repairs the opposite direction (260718): an assistant `tool_calls` round left dangling —
by an intervening user/developer barrier or an interrupted turn — is closed by deferring barrier
messages until the round completes, reattaching real results to their original call occurrence,
and synthesizing explicit "no tool result was recorded" answers only when no real result exists
(Kimi/Moonshot 400 `ocx-mrqaiw05-269`; unit `devlog/_fin/260718_dangling_toolcall_hardening`).

Forward-mode OpenAI passthrough also repairs replayed `call_id` values longer than the Responses
API's 64-character limit. Sidechat/fork replay can namespace routed-provider ids beyond that limit,
so each oversized id and all matching call/output items receive the same deterministic,
request-local alias. Raw API-key continuations deliberately preserve ids because an output-only
continuation may reference a call stored upstream under its original id; proxy-expanded API-key
replays are explicit and receive the same repair.

These compatibility guards are covered by focused tests and should stay close to the adapters that
need them.

## Cursor parameterized models

Cursor Router's parameterized `default` model is represented in Codex by four catalog rows:
`cursor/auto` preserves Cursor's team/account default, while `cursor/auto-cost`,
`cursor/auto-balance`, and `cursor/auto-intelligence` make each optimization level explicit.
All four route to the `default` Cursor wire model. Explicit variants additionally populate
`AgentRunRequest.requested_model.parameters` with the `optimization` parameter; this is the same
parameterized-model channel used by current Cursor clients. Router rows are static capabilities and
must survive a live `GetUsableModels` response that omits `default`.

`cursor/grok-4.5-fast` is also a stable Codex-facing row, but current Cursor clients do not request
it as a flat model slug. OpenCodex sends `grok-4.5` through `requested_model` with separate `effort`
and `fast=true` parameters, leaving legacy `model_details` unset for that parameterized external
selection. Live discovery still recognizes Cursor's flattened `cursor-grok-4.5-{effort}-fast`
variants, plus the older `grok-4.5-fast-{effort}` ordering, as availability evidence only.

## Cursor active-context usage

Cursor's `conversationCheckpointUpdate.tokenDetails.usedTokens` is treated as the authoritative
absolute active-context size for a Cursor conversation. Some client-tool suspension turns must end
before Cursor emits a new checkpoint; those turns carry forward the last observed total for the same
Cursor conversation instead of reporting only the tiny current-turn output delta. The carry-forward
cache is process-local, numeric-only, bounded, and keyed by Cursor conversation id. Compaction
boundaries clear the carry so pre-compaction totals are not reused after Codex replaces history.
Historical compaction markers restored by `previous_response_id` expansion are acknowledged as a
replayed prefix and do not clear a fresh post-compaction checkpoint again on every later turn.
Compaction summarizer turns may still report their own checkpoint for that response, but their
pre-compaction checkpoint is not persisted for later carry-forward.

```text
[Decision Log]
- 목적과 의도: Keep Codex's visible "context left" indicator aligned with Cursor's active-context usage on client-tool turns that finalize before a checkpoint arrives.
- 기존 구현 및 제약 조건: Checkpoint turns reported totalTokens correctly, but no-checkpoint client-tool finalize fell back to output-only usage and could overwrite a meaningful prior total with values like 109 tokens.
- 검토한 주요 대안: Add a longer wait for late checkpoints; infer prior+output totals; store full prompt/history state; carry forward only the last numeric checkpoint per Cursor conversation.
- 선택한 방식: Carry forward the last numeric absolute checkpoint per Cursor conversation with bounded LRU/TTL storage, update it only from live checkpoint frames, and clear/suppress it once when a newly appended compaction boundary starts an epoch; previous_response replay provenance acknowledges historical markers without serializing private metadata upstream.
- 다른 대안 대신 이 방식을 선택한 이유: It fixes the UI regression without delaying tool turns, fabricating token growth, storing prompt/tool content, or repeatedly clearing valid post-compaction usage when historical markers replay; one-time compaction resets still prevent stale over-report when history is replaced.
- 장점, 단점 및 영향: Active-context reporting stays monotonic within an uncompacted Cursor conversation; no-checkpoint turns remain estimated; a process restart loses the numeric cache, and when neither a checkpoint nor a carry-forward is available the turn reports a request-local estimate derived from the same pruned payload sent to Cursor (#373 — reporting output-only usage made Codex read the context as nearly empty). Estimates are never persisted or promoted into checkpoint carry-forward; only live checkpoint frames update the cache.
```

## OpenRouter provider routing

The canonical OpenRouter `openai-chat` transport may carry optional provider-routing preferences
from `OcxProviderConfig.openRouterRouting`, with exact model-id replacements in
`modelOpenRouterRouting`. The adapter maps camel-case config to OpenRouter's request wire
(`order`, `only`, `allow_fallbacks`) after the Codex-facing routed slug has been decoded to the
native model id.

Preferences are accepted only for `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1` (an optional trailing slash is
equivalent) and the `openai-chat` adapter. Alternate ports, credentials, query strings, fragments,
lookalike hosts, and custom proxy paths fail validation. A model override replaces rather than
merges the provider-wide default, keeping precedence deterministic. With no preference configured,
the request body is byte-for-byte unchanged in this area and OpenRouter retains its default routing.

## Kimi Coding Plan prompt-cache affinity

The canonical `kimi` OAuth and `kimi-code` API-key presets opt into forwarding the internal
request's `prompt_cache_key` to Kimi's Chat Completions body. Kimi Code Plan documents a stable
session/task key as required to improve cache hit rates. The chat adapter never invents a key of
its own: it forwards what the request already carries — Codex's session key on
`/v1/responses`, or the session-scoped key the Claude `/v1/messages` inbound derives
(metadata.user_id hash, else the system+tools cohort hash) — and a request with no key stays
keyless. An explicit provider-level `promptCacheKey: false` continues to opt out, and the flag is
persisted through `providerConfigSeed`/`enrichProviderFromRegistry` for new configs; key-pool 429
rotation keeps it — along with every other registry backfill — because the retry inherits the
request's routed provider and swaps only the API key (`rotateProviderTransportOn429` in
src/providers/key-failover.ts). If an opted-in upstream rejects the field, OpenCodex does not strip it and retry or mutate the
saved configuration. Other OpenAI-compatible providers remain deny-by-default because strict
backends may reject the OpenAI-specific field.

## xAI Grok hardening (official Grok Build contract parity)

Grounded in the open-sourced official client (xai-org/grok-build); unit + evidence:
`devlog/_fin/260716_grok_build_hardening/`.

- **Reasoning folding:** the Responses parser folds `reasoning` items into the FOLLOWING
  assistant turn (`pendingReasoning` in `src/responses/parser.ts`) so the Grok chat wire carries
  ONE assistant message with `reasoning_content` — exact-prefix cache stability. Unsigned
  siblings newline-join; `ocxr1`-signed siblings stay separate parts (Anthropic replay keeps
  each signature on its own text); boundaries (user/tool-result/agent) clear pending state;
  call items fold pending reasoning into the same turn.
- **Grok CLI credential ownership:** `source:"local-cli"` xAI credentials re-read
  `~/.grok/auth.json` (read-only) before any refresh and adopt a newer usable generation with
  zero IdP calls (`shouldAdoptGrokGeneration`, later-expiresAt authority); an IdP refresh
  detaches the credential to `source:"oauth"`.
- **Two-lock refresh transaction:** per-provider+account intent lock held across the IdP
  exchange plus a short global store-write lock + async mutation funnel around every
  `auth.json` load-merge-persist (`src/oauth/store.ts`); generation-guarded persist
  (`expectedGeneration` → superseded adoption), conditional `needsReauth`, bounded jittered
  retry for transient token-endpoint failures.
- **Reactive 401 replay:** the serving recovery loop force-refreshes once (singleflight,
  generation-checked) and replays OAuth-backed xAI requests exactly once with a re-resolved
  transport; API-key/BYOK paths excluded (`src/server/responses.ts`).
- **Header parity:** per-attempt `x-grok-req-id` (fresh UUID inside the transport fetch
  wrapper), stable session/conv affinity headers, always-set User-Agent, and a single
  compatibility profile const for the Grok client version (`src/providers/xai-transport.ts`);
  `fetchWithHeaderTimeout` takes an executor so provider fetch wrappers stay inside the
  timeout race.

## Kiro reasoning round-trip (`redactedContent`)

Kiro never returns plaintext reasoning for its **GPT-5.6 family** (`gpt-5.6-sol`, `-terra`,
`-luna`): `reasoningContentEvent` carries a KMS-encrypted `redactedContent` blob, never `text`.
Their `additionalModelRequestFieldsSchema` (`ListAvailableModels`) accepts only `reasoning.effort`
with `additionalProperties: false` — there is no display/summary opt-in, so this is the only
reasoning these models can return. Kiro's own CLI replays the blob on the matching
`assistantResponseMessage.reasoningContent` to preserve model reasoning across turns; dropping it
makes every turn restart without the previous turn's reasoning. Verified on kiro-cli 2.14.1 and
2.16.0, all three models.

The Claude 4.6+/5 entries advertise a different, richer contract (`thinking.type` adaptive/disabled,
`thinking.display` summarized/omitted, `output_config.effort`, `max_tokens`) and are not covered by
that measurement; older Claude, deepseek, minimax, glm, and qwen entries advertise no additional
fields at all. The handling below keys off the wire field, not the model id, so any model that
sends `redactedContent` round-trips.

- The blob rides the existing `ocxr1:` envelope as `krc` (`src/responses/reasoning-envelope.ts`) on
  an envelope-only reasoning item — `summary: []`, no text deltas — so it stays invisible in the
  Codex app while round-tripping, exactly like the hidden-thinking path.
- **Pairing is backwards.** Kiro emits `reasoningContentEvent` at the END of an assistant turn,
  after content AND tool calls. A `krc`-only item therefore belongs to the turn that already
  closed, so the parser attaches it to the PRECEDING assistant message rather than folding it into
  the following turn like ordinary reasoning (`src/responses/parser.ts`). With no assistant turn to
  own it, the blob is dropped rather than mis-paired.
- The blob lives on `OcxAssistantMessage.kiroRedactedReasoning`, not on a thinking content part, so
  no other adapter replays provider-private state if the conversation switches providers.

Kiro reports context pressure in its own `contextUsageEvent`, which is the authoritative source. On
every capture taken (2.14.1 and 2.16.0) `metadataEvent` carried only `stopReason` — which is why
reading the percentage from `metadataEvent` alone never saw a value — but the parser still accepts a
finite `contextUsagePercentage` (and a `tokenUsage` block) there as a fallback, so a value parsed
from `metadataEvent` is legitimate rather than impossible. Both feed the same field, and any
positive value overwrites an earlier one.

Spend arrives in `meteringEvent` as **credits, not tokens**. No captured response carried
`tokenUsage` on any event, which is why Kiro usage stays estimated; `meteringEvent` is currently
ignored because a credit is not a token count.

## Parallel tool calls (default-on for chat providers)

The openai-chat adapter buffers ALL streamed `tool_calls` deltas (keyed by `index`, falling back to
`id`, then last-seen) and flushes them as atomic start/delta/end sequences at the terminal signal.
This is required by the bridge's sequential tool-call contract and makes interleaved parallel
deltas, id-only-first-chunk continuations, and whole-chunk multi-call frames all safe.

Parallel tool calls are DEFAULT-ON for openai-chat providers: the adapter follows Codex's
request-level `parallel_tool_calls` bit (default true) and routed catalog entries advertise
`supports_parallel_tool_calls`. `OcxProviderConfig.parallelToolCalls: false` is the per-provider
opt-out (registry-seeded, router-backfilled; an explicit user value always wins). Non-chat
adapters advertise the catalog bit only on explicit `true`; cursor keeps its own special-casing.
Providers with flaky parallel streaming can be opted out individually. Evidence and provider
ledger: `devlog/_fin/260709_parallel_tool_calls/`.

## Reasoning display parity (hideThinkingSummary)

`hideThinkingSummary` (request reasoning summary absent/"none" — the routed catalog default) is
honored by BOTH reasoning paths: anthropic `thinking_delta` AND raw `reasoning_raw_delta`
(openai-chat `reasoning_content`, kiro tags). Hidden reasoning emits an envelope-only reasoning
item (`summary: []`, txt-only `ocxr1:` `encrypted_content`, no text deltas) — invisible in the
Codex app, so tool cells group like native models — while the text still round-trips for
`preserveReasoningContentModels` replay. Visible mode (summary "auto") keeps the raw
`content[reasoning_text]` shape. Diagnosis and codex-rs grouping evidence:
`devlog/_fin/260709_native_response_pattern/`.

## Chat-to-Responses message phase inference

Chat Completions streams do not carry the Responses `message.phase` field. The bridge keeps an
unphased live message provisional while its deltas arrive, then assigns `commentary` when a later
tool, search, reasoning, or assistant boundary proves that more work follows, and assigns
`final_answer` only when a clean terminal `done` closes the current message. Explicit adapter
phases always win. Streaming `output_item.added` remains unphased until that future boundary is
known; `output_item.done` and the terminal response snapshot carry the authoritative inferred phase
with the same item id. The batch/non-streaming bridge follows the same rule.

```text
[Decision Log]
- 목적과 의도: Prevent Codex App from rendering one bridged Chat Completions answer as both live commentary and a second persisted final answer.
- 기존 구현 및 제약 조건: openai-chat emits text deltas without phase, the bridge streamed them immediately, and whether text is pre-tool commentary or the terminal answer is unknowable until a later boundary arrives.
- 검토한 주요 대안: Mark every delta final_answer; mark every delta commentary; buffer the entire answer before emitting; infer phase only when the message is finalized.
- 선택한 방식: Keep the live added item provisional and infer commentary or final_answer at the authoritative close boundary, preserving explicit phases and item identity in done/completed output.
- 다른 대안 대신 이 방식을 선택한 이유: Eager defaults misclassify either tool preambles or final answers, while full buffering removes live streaming; close-time inference provides correct persisted semantics without adding latency.
- 장점, 단점 및 영향: Codex App receives a definitive phase for persisted bridged messages and avoids the duplicate-final rendering path; the provisional output_item.added event intentionally has no phase because its classification is not yet knowable.
```

## Upstream reset retry

`src/lib/upstream-retry.ts` guards upstream fetches against stale pooled keep-alive sockets
(Cloudflare closes idle connections; Bun's fetch reuses the dead socket and rejects with
`ECONNRESET` before any response bytes). `fetchWithResetRetry` retries only
connection-reset-shaped rejections (up to 3 total attempts, jittered backoff, warn-logged);
timeouts, aborts, `ECONNREFUSED`, HTTP error statuses, and mid-stream SSE failures are never
retried. Guarded paths: the ChatGPT passthrough and generic adapter fetch in
`src/server/responses.ts`, the vision/web-search sidecars, and the web-search loop's direct-fetch
fallback. Adapters with their own `fetchResponse` (kiro, cursor, google) keep their own retry
policies; kiro imports the shared abort/sleep helpers from this module.

## Same-provider combo quota fallback

For a failover combo with multiple models on the same Codex-login OpenAI provider, a pre-stream
429/402 carrying only `x-codex-*-reset-at` may advance to the later model on the same account. The
failed physical combo target still enters its normal target cooldown. An explicit `Retry-After`
remains an account-wide instruction and blocks the later target; a quota response with neither an
explicit retry delay nor a usable reset timestamp keeps the conservative default account cooldown.
This exception is request-scoped and is not applied to direct requests, round-robin combos, or a
combo whose remaining eligible targets use other providers.

```text
[Decision Log]
- 목적과 의도: Let an ordered combo recover when one model-specific Codex quota window is exhausted but another model on the same account remains usable.
- 기존 구현 및 제약 조건: Account health is shared across models, and recording a reset-derived 429 before combo advancement rejected the later model locally.
- 검토한 주요 대안: Make every quota cooldown model-scoped; ignore all combo 429 cooldowns; or defer only reset-derived cooldown recording for an eligible later same-provider failover target.
- 선택한 방식: Use the narrow request-scoped deferral while retaining target cooldown and all explicit Retry-After/default account cooldown behavior.
- 다른 대안 대신 이 방식을 선택한 이유: Reset timestamps identify quota windows rather than a literal account-wide retry instruction, but widening the exception would risk hot retries and provider abuse.
- 장점, 단점 및 영향: Same-account model fallback works without weakening explicit upstream backoff; the account health map intentionally does not remember that one deferred reset-derived failure, while the combo target map does.
```

## Transport inventory

The sections above cover the transports with load-bearing invariants. The rest of the transport
surface is listed here so a maintainer can find the owner without grepping:

| Transport | Owner | Invariant worth knowing |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Azure OpenAI Responses | `src/adapters/azure.ts` | Deployment-shaped URLs on top of the Responses contract. |
| Google / Vertex / Antigravity | `src/adapters/google.ts`, `src/adapters/google-http.ts`, `src/adapters/google-wire-compiler.ts`, `src/adapters/google-tool-schema.ts`, `src/adapters/google-truncation.ts`, `src/adapters/google-errors.ts`, `src/adapters/google-antigravity-wire.ts`, `src/adapters/google-antigravity-replay.ts` | Vertex and Antigravity install a Google-family `fetchResponse` and so own their retry policy, while AI Studio Gemini leaves it undefined and uses the default server fetch path. The Google-family wrapper reuses the shared abort/deadline helpers (`src/lib/upstream-retry.ts`), wire-body repair, and upstream error normalization. |
| Mimo Free | `src/adapters/mimo-free.ts` | Client identity and JWT handling are transport-local; the per-install client id lives in the opencodex state root. |
| Anthropic image ingress | `src/adapters/anthropic-image-guard.ts`, `src/adapters/anthropic-image-normalize.ts` | Oversized or unsupported images are normalized or rejected before reaching upstream. |
| Adapter execution support | `src/adapters/run-turn-queue.ts`, `src/adapters/tool-catalog-nudge.ts`, `src/adapters/identity.ts`, `src/adapters/image.ts`, `src/adapters/upstream-http-error.ts` | Shared machinery: turn ordering, tool-catalog nudging, client fingerprinting, image conversion, upstream error normalization. |
| Cursor (beyond the sections above) | `src/adapters/cursor/live-transport.ts`, `src/adapters/cursor/transport-retry.ts`, `src/adapters/cursor/mcp-manager.ts`, `src/adapters/cursor/thread-continuity.ts` | Thread continuity is the point: a retry must not start a new Cursor thread. |
| Claude Messages | `src/server/claude-messages.ts` | Routed translation, a native Anthropic passthrough branch, and `count_tokens`. |
| Chat Completions inbound | `src/server/chat-completions.ts`, `src/chat/` | Inbound translation onto the same routing pipeline. |
| Hosted search relay | `src/server/search.ts` | Direct relay; distinct from the web-search sidecar loop below. |
| Image/video generation loop | `src/images/loop.ts`, `src/images/plan.ts`, `src/images/fulfill.ts`, `src/images/xai-client.ts`, `src/images/xai-video-client.ts`, `src/images/artifacts.ts` | A provider-returned image URL is downloaded into a local artifact once, then served locally; warnings stay URL-free because provider CDN URLs may embed credentials. |
| GitHub Copilot | `src/providers/xai-transport.ts` (`resolveProviderTransport`), `src/providers/github-copilot-transport.ts` | `resolveProviderTransport` selects the Copilot transport when the routed provider name is `github-copilot`; the Copilot module then resolves its headers and base URL, and the registry seeds the provider row and model fallback. |
| API-key pools | `src/providers/key-failover.ts` | A 429 rotates the active key and records a cooldown; `provider.apiKey` keeps mirroring the active entry so routing stays single-key. |
| Alibaba regions | `src/providers/alibaba-region-backup.ts`, `src/providers/alibaba-region-migration.ts`, `src/providers/alibaba-region-startup.ts` | Region migration backs up before rewriting and is idempotent across restarts. |
| Discovery and quota | `src/providers/model-discovery.ts`, `src/providers/quota.ts` | Discovery rejects a response over 4 MiB or past 2,000 raw rows before caching it. |

## Sidecars

Web search and vision sidecars run only when the main request needs that capability and a usable
sidecar authority exists. Both have two possible backends, but they select differently:

| Sidecar | Backend selection | Default model | Activation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `web-search/` | Explicit configuration only: unset always resolves to the OpenAI forward path. Anthropic is never auto-selected from credential availability — doing so once sent OpenAI model ids to the Anthropic API. | `gpt-5.6-luna` (OpenAI), `claude-sonnet-5` (Anthropic) | Hosted `web_search` requested by a non-passthrough routed model. |
| `vision/` | Explicit configuration wins for both backends. Only an unset backend auto-selects: Anthropic when a usable Anthropic OAuth provider exists, otherwise the OpenAI forward authority. An explicitly selected backend whose authority is unavailable produces no plan rather than falling back. | `claude-sonnet-5` (Anthropic), `gpt-5.4-mini` (OpenAI) | Input contains images for a model listed in `noVisionModels`. |

The asymmetry is in the unset case only: vision may describe an image with whichever model can see
it, while a hosted search tool is tied to a provider-specific tool contract, so search never infers
Anthropic from credentials alone.

On the OpenAI path there is one deterministic `openai` sidecar candidate and its current account mode
owns credential selection; API-key OpenAI is not a ChatGPT forward sidecar candidate.

Sidecar failures must degrade to text markers or skipped capability, not abort the main request.

## Provider Split Bridge (activation-gated)

The split bridge is a separate transport boundary from the existing adapter bridge. Its currently
implemented bounded surface is HTTP/SSE `POST /v1/responses`, `POST /v1/responses/compact`, and local
`GET /healthz`: official-native requests use the canonical ChatGPT/Codex target without entering the
10100 listener, while explicit third-party slugs are forwarded to 10100 with OpenAI/Codex authorization
headers removed and a bridge-only admission header injected. Each channel owns its target, cancellation,
error mapping, and stream budget. WebSocket/app-server, Images, search, Live/Realtime, and
continuation/replay paths require separate compatibility tests; an unimplemented surface must fail
closed rather than silently taking the other channel. `ocx split-bridge start` and the plist builder are
available for isolated validation, but until activation the current single-listener transport inventory
remains authoritative.
