# Config And Codex Home SOT

## Codex home

`src/codex/paths.ts` resolves Codex state from `CODEX_HOME` when set and valid, otherwise from
`~/.codex`. An unset `CODEX_HOME` falls back to `~/.codex`, including WSL discovery. An explicitly
set path that is unreadable or not a directory is an error, not a fallback: silently using a
different home than the operator named would write provider state where nobody is looking for it.
The managed files are:

```text
$CODEX_HOME/config.toml
$CODEX_HOME/opencodex.config.toml
$CODEX_HOME/opencodex-catalog.json
$CODEX_HOME/opencodex-journal.json
$CODEX_HOME/models_cache.json
$CODEX_HOME/.opencodex-native-main-profiles/
```

Never assume macOS-only paths. Windows, service installs, and app-launched Codex can all depend on
the resolved `CODEX_HOME`.

Native-main profile ownership is bound to the real `CODEX_HOME`, not to an OpenCodex instance.
Its encrypted vault, transaction journal, recovery marker, and referenced quarantine files live in
the owner-only `.opencodex-native-main-profiles` directory. The unchanged
`.opencodex-native-profile.lock.sqlite` beside that directory serializes every process sharing the
home. Only plaintext login staging is instance-local under
`$OPENCODEX_HOME/native-main-profile-staging`; a stage from one instance is invalid in another.
These paths and the OS keyring are owner-only: the operating-system account that owns them is the
trust boundary and already has direct access to active native credentials. OpenCodex detects and
fails closed on file identities that change during an operation, but it does not claim isolation
from a malicious process already running as that same trusted OS account.

OpenCodex never overrides an explicit `CODEX_HOME`. On Windows, `ocx doctor` and `ocx status`
nevertheless diagnose the high-confidence Orca dual-home case: both `CODEX_HOME` and
`ORCA_CODEX_HOME` select Orca's `orca/codex-runtime-home/home`, while the ChatGPT/Codex app uses the
default `%USERPROFILE%\\.codex`. Sync and restore output always prints the exact target Codex home;
display and JSON paths redact the OS username. The diagnostic tells users to invoke OpenCodex with
the app home explicitly rather than silently claiming that an unrelated app was configured. If a
service was installed under the Orca home, it must first be uninstalled from that original Orca
environment and then reinstalled under the app home; changing only the current shell cannot migrate
the recorded service ownership.

[Decision Log]
- 목적과 의도: Make multi-home injection truthful without taking ownership of user environment variables.
- 기존 구현 및 제약 조건: CODEX_HOME is an intentional override, but Orca exports it for its own bundled runtime and the Windows app reads a different home.
- 검토한 주요 대안: Rewrite CODEX_HOME automatically, warn for every custom home, or detect only the Orca-owned signature and report the target path.
- 선택한 방식: Preserve the override, add a narrow Windows/Orca diagnostic, and qualify sync/restore success output with the effective home.
- 다른 대안 대신 이 방식을 선택한 이유: It fixes the silent failure while avoiding destructive or noisy behavior for intentional custom homes.
- 장점, 단점 및 영향: Orca users get an actionable warning; other multi-home products remain unchanged until they have an equally reliable signature.

`atomicWriteFile` uses a temp file named `{path}.ocx.{pid}.{seq}.tmp` (process ID + incrementing
sequence number) to avoid collisions when concurrent writers (e.g. `ocx stop` and the proxy's own
shutdown handler) both restore Codex config simultaneously. The temp is renamed atomically into place.

Response-state loading performs a bounded recovery pass for interrupted snapshot writes. It only
matches regular files named `responses-state.json.ocx.<pid>.<sequence>.tmp`, waits at least 15
minutes, and skips the current or any live PID. Eligible files are truncated before unlinking so a
matching stale path is unlinked without following it. Path-based truncation is intentionally avoided:
a same-user replacement could otherwise turn cleanup into a write through a symlink. Unrelated
temporary files, symlinks, directories, and young/active writes are never touched; directory entries
are consumed incrementally and at most 512 stale files are attempted per process start.

[Decision Log]
- 목적과 의도: Bound disk and conversation-state retention after abrupt process termination.
- 기존 구현 및 제약 조건: Ordinary write failures clean up immediately, but a killed process cannot run that path and Windows may temporarily lock files.
- 검토한 주요 대안: Delete every `.tmp`, rely on manual cleanup, or recover only exact response-state remnants with age and PID guards.
- 선택한 방식: Run a capped, best-effort, unlink-only sweep on lazy response-state startup.
- 다른 대안 대신 이 방식을 선택한 이유: It repairs known remnants without broad authority over unrelated temp files or active writers.
- 장점, 단점 및 영향: Old dead-PID files are reclaimed automatically; locked or conservatively classified files remain for a later retry.

## Config surface

`src/types.ts` is the shape and `src/config.ts` is the loader; neither is reproduced here. What
matters for maintainers is which groups exist and who resolves them:

| Group | Keys | Resolution rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Listener | `port`, `hostname` | The listener owns the port; `runtime-port.json` reports where it actually landed. |
| Routing | `defaultProvider`, `providers`, per-provider `selectedModels`, `codexRoutingMode` | Explicit `provider/model` wins over `defaultProvider`; missing `codexRoutingMode` remains `legacy-local`, while `split` selects the isolated 10101 Codex entry point. |
| Catalog | `disabledModels`, `customModels`, `modelCacheTtlMs`, `providerContextCaps`, `contextCapValue` | Catalog state is derived; config only records intent. |
| Retained state | `appOwnedMemoryBudgetMb` | Process-wide eviction target for app-owned logs, caches, blobs, and continuation payloads. Default 256 MiB, valid 64..4096; pinned state may temporarily exceed the target, but every pin-capable store has a finite local cap and their documented aggregate stays below `APP_OWNED_WORST_CASE_PINNED_BYTES` (512 MiB). Neither value caps RSS or native runtime memory. |
| Transport | stream mode, timeouts, proxy settings, `websockets` | `streamMode` persists in config.json; Windows services need a persisted input, and macOS uses it for explicit eager-relay opt-in. |
| Credentials | `apiKeys` | Data-plane only; never admitted to `/api/*`. |
| Lifecycle | `codexAutoStart`, shim/start behavior, resume-history sync, storage cleanup | Startup safety reads these; see [`05_gui-and-management-api.md`](05_gui-and-management-api.md). |

Env values are resolved through `src/config.ts`, so a config value naming an env var never persists
the secret itself.

## Config injection

`src/codex/inject.ts` writes one of two forms. The choice is not cosmetic: it decides whether Codex
keeps its native provider id, which decides whether existing thread history still resolves.

**Loopback (default).** A single marker-owned root override, no provider table:

```toml
model_catalog_json = "/absolute/path/to/opencodex-catalog.json"
openai_base_url = "http://127.0.0.1:10100/v1"
```

Codex keeps the native `openai` provider id, so new threads stay under that identity instead of
being re-tagged. History that an earlier legacy injection re-tagged as `opencodex` is migrated back
to `openai` once, as restore machinery — a no-op when there is nothing to migrate. A user-owned root
`openai_base_url` is preserved instead of overwritten, and that case also blocks managed sub-agent
defaults rather than fighting the user for ownership.

**API auth header (non-loopback).** The built-in `openai` provider cannot carry the
`x-opencodex-api-key` env header, so this form re-tags the root provider and appends the table:

```toml
model_provider = "opencodex"
model_catalog_json = "/absolute/path/to/opencodex-catalog.json"

[model_providers.opencodex]
name = "OpenCodex Proxy"
base_url = "http://<host>:<port>/v1"
wire_api = "responses"
requires_openai_auth = true
env_http_headers = { "x-opencodex-api-key" = "OPENCODEX_API_AUTH_TOKEN" }
```

Root TOML keys must be written before the first `[table]`. Re-injection strips the stale form of
both shapes — opencodex blocks, injected root base-url overrides, stale root context-window
overrides, and stale catalog paths — before rewriting, so switching between forms leaves no residue.

Native Codex sub-agent defaults are a separate, explicit opt-in. When
`syncCodexSubagentDefaults` is true and `injectionModel` is set, injection writes marker-owned
`agents.default_subagent_model` and, when configured,
`agents.default_subagent_reasoning_effort`. Unmarked values are user-owned and must never be
overwritten. Disabling the option and fallback restore remove only marker-owned values; journal
restore must preserve later user edits while stripping those managed values.

If the root config selects a provider other than `openai` or `opencodex`, injection must leave the
config byte-for-byte unchanged and skip profile creation/updates and history migration. External
provider managers own that routing configuration, and replacing their provider id can hide
otherwise intact Codex sessions. This ownership check must run before catalog/cache refresh,
journal creation, and the background history migration guardian.

`supports_websockets = true` is appended to the provider table only when `websocketsEnabled(config)`
returns true.

## Codex-home diagnostics

Some Codex-home conditions are reported rather than repaired, because repairing them would overwrite
a deliberate user choice:

- Bundled-plugin marketplace state on Windows (`src/codex/plugins-doctor.ts`), surfaced by
  `ocx status`.
- Project-level Codex config that bypasses managed routing
  (`src/codex/project-config-warnings.ts`), surfaced by `ocx doctor` as a warning rather than an
  override.

## Profile and fast tier

When opencodex owns routing, it also writes `$CODEX_HOME/opencodex.config.toml` as an explicit profile
target. Codex config uses `service_tier = "fast"` and `[features].fast_mode = true`;
catalog/request tier metadata may use `priority`. Do not collapse these spellings into one value.

## Provider output defaults

`OcxProviderConfig.defaultMaxOutputTokens` and `modelMaxOutputTokens` are OpenAI Chat wire defaults,
not context-window metadata. They are applied only when a Responses request omits
`max_output_tokens`; an explicit request value wins, then a model-specific configured value, then
the provider default, then the adapter omits `max_tokens`.

Both fields must stay positive finite integers at disk-config and management validation boundaries.
Registry entries may seed them through `providerConfigSeed`, key-login derivation, OAuth reconcile,
and `routeModel`, but user config overrides registry defaults per field/key.

## Restore

`ocx stop`, `ocx restore` / `ocx eject`, `ocx service stop`, and `ocx service uninstall` must strip
opencodex config and routed catalog entries without damaging native Codex state.

Full `ocx uninstall` config cleanup is ownership-manifest based. A fresh config directory receives a
root-bound owner marker and an uninstall manifest before its first atomic config write. Uninstall
validates both bounded metadata files, rejects path traversal and a symlink/junction config root,
and removes only normalized manifest entries. Manifest-owned directory links are unlinked without
traversing their targets. Unknown files remain in place and make the command report a partial
uninstall with their exact paths.

Legacy nonempty config directories are deliberately not retroactively claimed. If either ownership
file is missing, malformed, or bound to another root, uninstall refuses config deletion and reports
the residual directory for manual review; there is no recursive-delete fallback.

## Provider Split Bridge state (implemented, activation-gated)

Split mode now has a marker-owned state that points Codex's single client entry at
`http://127.0.0.1:10101/v1`; the bridge, not Codex TOML, maps the selected catalog slug to the
official or third-party physical channel. The existing 10100 loopback form remains the legacy-local
state and is never overwritten blindly. Migration first proves journal/marker ownership, preserves
user-owned `openai_base_url`, and writes the bridge target atomically. Restore removes only
bridge-owned keys and catalog/cache changes; it does not depend on an `exit` handler, because SIGKILL
and power loss can leave files behind. The target state, backup manifest, and failure recovery
contract are recorded in [`docs/协议文档.md`](../docs/协议文档.md). The 10101 listener, LaunchAgent
installation, and Codex routing switch remain activation-gated and are not performed by these docs
or static builders.
