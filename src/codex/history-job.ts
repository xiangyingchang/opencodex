/**
 * The parent half of the history unit: derive the operation, dispatch the
 * Worker, and never let its failure become the caller's stall.
 *
 * The operation is DERIVED here from what the caller already decided — its
 * config and the direction its native mutation just took — and then handed down
 * as a fixed value. It is not a request field the Worker trusts, because the
 * distinctions are real: `syncResumeHistory: false` means leave history alone,
 * apply targets opencodex only in legacy mode, and legacy recovery must not
 * touch the manifest that generic restore consumes.
 *
 * Every exit is typed. A Worker that errors, dies, or overruns its watchdog
 * produces an outcome the caller can record, because the alternative — an
 * exception crossing back into a route that already persisted its mutation — is
 * how a successful change gets reported as a 500.
 *
 * Design record: devlog/_fin/260804_codex_write_substrate/020_history_isolation.md.
