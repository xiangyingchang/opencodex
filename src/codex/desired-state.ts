/**
 * Durable desired state for the native Codex integration.
 *
 * The switch itself was never the hard part — `ocx restore` already returns Codex
 * to its native path without stopping the proxy. What was missing is that the
 * decision did not survive: `ocx start` force-synced unconditionally, so an OFF
 * lasted exactly until the next start. That is the defect this module closes, and
 * it is the same one Grok's shipped toggle still has.
 *
 * ABSENT MEANS ON. A user who never touched a switch, a config written by an
 * older binary, and an explicit `true` are the same state, and none of them may
 * be read as "the user turned this off". Only an explicit `false` is OFF.
 *
 * This module does NOT own linearization. The plan that predates
 * `src/codex/user-identity.ts` proposed a second per-home lock at
 * `tmpdir()/opencodex-native-locks/sha256(home).sqlite`; that keys on the home
 * alone, carries no proof of effective user, and would collide or split
 * depending on the temp root. Convergence takes the write lock; this module only
 * records intent through the config coordinator.
 *
 * Design record: devlog/_plan/260803_codex_desktop_toggle/030_desired_state.md.
