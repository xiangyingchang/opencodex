/**
 * Client-neutral config export core.
 *
 * One pure function per client, one shared input type. Every export surface (CLI,
 * management API, GUI) consumes this module so the bytes a user copies, downloads, or
 * curls can never drift between surfaces.
 *
 * Two invariants carried over from `ocx opencode` (src/cli/opencode.ts), which owned the
 * OpenCode serializer before it moved here:
 *
 * - **No secret is ever serialized.** Configs carry only the client's documented env
 *   reference (`{env:VAR}` for OpenCode, `$VAR` for Pi); the real admission key travels
 *   through the environment. AGENTS.md treats token serialization as a release blocker.
 * - **No metadata is guessed.** A model with no authoritative context window ships
 *   without context/output fields, and the client applies its own defaults. Pi's `cost`
 *   is omitted entirely rather than zero-filled, because zeros would assert "free",
 *   which is false for routed providers.
 *
 * This module never writes a file. `destination` names the canonical path for a human;
 * targeting it is the caller's explicit act.

 * --modalities audio`, `/api/custom-models`, and provider discovery.
