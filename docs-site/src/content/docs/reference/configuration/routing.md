title: Routing Configuration
description: Default-provider selection, model resolution order, combo aliases, target ordering, and effort defaults.
---

Routing turns the model id sent by a client into one concrete provider and upstream model.

## Top-level routing fields

| Field | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `defaultProvider` | `string` | `"openai"` | Final provider used when no earlier model rule matches. It must name an enabled configured provider. |
| `combos?` | `Record<string, OcxComboConfig>` | `{}` | Virtual `combo/<id>` models built from ordered provider/model targets. |
| `routingProfiles?` | `Record<string, OcxRoutingProfileConfig>` | `{}` | Virtual `policy/<id>` models that select among an explicit candidate allowlist using hard capability requirements and deterministic scoring. |

## Model resolution order

opencodex resolves the requested model in this order:

1. An explicit `policy/<id>` or configured routing-profile alias, executing the policy evaluator
   and routing the selected candidate. An unknown profile id fails closed.
2. A configured `<account-selector>/<native-openai-model>` namespace, routed through exactly the
   mapped stored Codex account. An invalid or unavailable exact target fails closed.
3. A canonical `combo/<id>` or configured combo alias. Canonical ids win before alias matching.
4. An explicit `<provider>/<model>` namespace whose prefix names a configured provider.
5. A bare native OpenAI-family id such as `gpt-*`, `o1-*`, `o3-*`, or `o4-*`, routed through the
   canonical enabled `openai` provider.
6. An exact match for a provider's `defaultModel`.
7. A known provider-family model prefix.
8. An exact model in a provider's configured `models` list.
9. `defaultProvider`, preserving the requested model id.

Disabled providers are excluded. An explicit namespace for a disabled provider fails instead of
falling through. Provider entries are checked in their JSON insertion order for rules that can match
more than one provider, so use explicit namespaces when a bare model could be ambiguous.

## Exact Codex account selectors

`codexAccountNamespaces` maps a public selector such as `side` to one stored Codex account. A
request for `side/gpt-5.6-sol` uses only that account, even when the canonical `openai` provider is
in Direct mode, and sends the bare `gpt-5.6-sol` model id upstream. Only bare native OpenAI-family
ids are valid after the selector.

Exact selection bypasses Pool assignment strategy and ordinary thread affinity. If the mapped
account is missing, paused, cooling down, unusable, or requires reauthentication, the request fails
closed instead of switching accounts and does not change the active Pool account. When at least one
eligible selector is configured, Codex catalogs hide bare native picker rows and list a separate
`<selector>/<native-openai-model>` row for each selector. Bare native ids retain normal Pool/Direct
routing and remain in raw `/v1/models` discovery unless explicitly disabled. Selectors whose mapped
stored account is missing are not advertised. Selector validation, collision rules, and privacy guidance are documented in
[Provider Configuration](/reference/configuration/providers/).

## Combos (`config.combos`)

Each combo key is an id matching `[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9._-]{0,63}`. It is always directly addressable
as `combo/<id>` and may also expose one `alias`. Aliases must be unique, cannot occupy the `combo/`
namespace, and cannot use reserved bare native families such as `gpt-*`, `o1-*`, `o3-*`, `o4-*`, or
`codex-*`.

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `targets` | `{ provider: string; model: string; weight?: number }[]` | required | Ordered concrete routes. `weight` is 1–10000 and defaults to `1`. |
| `strategy?` | `"failover" \| "round-robin"` | `"failover"` | Selection strategy. Target order is failover priority; weights shape smooth weighted round-robin. |
| `stickyLimit?` | `number` | `1` | Successful requests retained in one round-robin batch. Range 1–100. |
| `defaultEffort?` | `"low" \| "medium" \| "high" \| "xhigh" \| "max" \| "ultra" \| null` | unset | Applied only when the caller omits effort and the selected target advertises the requested rung. |
| `alias?` | `string` | — | Optional public model id in place of the canonical picker slug. |

    }
  }
}
```

## Routing policy profiles (`config.routingProfiles`)

Routing policy profiles are the Router Intelligence selection layer: an explicitly requested
`policy/<id>` (or configured alias) selects among a fixed candidate allowlist using hard capability
requirements and deterministic, explainable scoring. An explicit `policy/<id>` request (or a
configured alias) executes the evaluator and routes the selected candidate. Existing model ids are
**never** routed through a profile implicitly: the `policy/` namespace and profile aliases are the
only entry points, and both are validated against the model resolution order above.

Each key is an id matching `[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9._-]{0,63}`, always addressable as `policy/<id>`,
with one optional `alias`. Aliases must be unique and cannot collide with configured providers,
the `<provider>/<model>` routing namespace, combos, codex account namespaces, the `policy/`
namespace, or reserved bare native families (`gpt-*`, `o1-*`, `o3-*`, `o4-*`, `codex-*`).

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `candidates` | `{ provider: string; model: string }[]` | required | Explicit allowlist of `provider/model` refs. No implicit expansion. |
| `alias?` | `string` | — | Optional public model id in place of `policy/<id>`. |
| `require?` | object | `{}` | Hard capability requirements evaluated before scoring (see below). |
| `optimize?` | object | latency 0.55, health 0.25, cost 0.10, quota 0.10 | Scoring weights, normalized deterministically. `health`, `quota`, and `cost` have score dimensions; the configured-priority share is `1 - health - quota - cost` (default 0.55), and `latency` folds into that priority share rather than scoring independently. |
| `limits?` | object | — | Hard limits, e.g. `maxEstimatedCostUsd` (enforced by the dry-run evaluator when candidate cost evidence is known). |
| `unknownEvidence?` | object | capability `exclude`, health/quota/cost `penalize` | How unknown evidence is treated per dimension: `allow`, `penalize`, or `exclude`. Unknown never becomes zero. |

`require` supports: `minContextWindow` (positive integer), `minQuotaHeadroom` (0..1 fraction),
and the booleans `tools`, `imageInput`, `structuredOutput`, `localOnly`, `remoteAllowed`,
`encryptedCodexTasks`; plus `reasoningEffort` and `serviceTier` strings.

For `unknownEvidence.capability`, `penalize` currently behaves like `allow`: scoring has only a
configured-priority component until a capability score dimension ships (planned with RI-06+), so
`penalize` cannot yet change the selected candidate.

Request evidence is evaluated against candidate capabilities together with the profile `require`
block; a candidate must satisfy both to be eligible. On the live request path the proxy derives
tools and image-input evidence from the request body; context-window size and the remaining
evidence dimensions stay unknown at routing time. Use the dry-run API/CLI to inspect the full
evidence surface for context-sensitive profiles.

The CLI dry-run accepts request-evidence flags but cannot supply candidate capability evidence yet;
candidate evidence is provided through the API (`POST /api/routing-profiles/dry-run`).

```json
{
  "routingProfiles": {
    "fast": {
      "alias": "ocx/fast",
      "candidates": [
        { "provider": "anthropic", "model": "claude-sonnet-5" },
        { "provider": "openai", "model": "gpt-5.6-sol" }
      ],
      "require": { "tools": true, "minContextWindow": 128000 },
      "optimize": { "latency": 0.55, "health": 0.25, "cost": 0.10, "quota": 0.10 },
      "limits": { "maxEstimatedCostUsd": 0.50 },
      "unknownEvidence": {
        "capability": "exclude",
        "health": "penalize",
        "quota": "penalize",
        "cost": "penalize"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

CLI: `ocx route policy list [--json]`, `ocx route policy show <id> [--json]`, and
`ocx route policy dry-run <id> [--model-context <tokens>] [--tools] [--image] [--structured-output] [--json]`.
Dry-run evaluates candidates without sending any upstream request.

Quota evidence (`optimize.quota`, `require.minQuotaHeadroom`, `unknownEvidence.quota`) comes from
the local Codex pool and Anthropic account quota caches, which are keyed by account. In **Pool** mode
the canonical `openai` provider preserves its existing account selection, then reads quota for the
selected account; **Direct** mode reads quota only from the current (caller/main) account. For other
providers (e.g. Anthropic), runtime candidates use the provider's active account. Quota evidence
never changes account selection, session affinity, cooldowns, or switching behavior — it only feeds
policy scoring. To see quota-aware behavior in a dry-run, supply account refs through the dry-run/API
candidate evidence: `candidates[].codexAccountId` (Codex pool, provider `openai`) or
`candidates[].accountRef` (Anthropic) derives the matching cached account quota; an explicit
`candidates[].quota` object is echoed as given.

### Combos vs policy profiles

- A **combo** is explicit ordered/weighted target routing and failover: the configured order (or
  smooth weighted round-robin) decides, and failures advance through the list.
- A **policy profile** is evidence-based selection among configured candidates: hard capability
  requirements filter first, then deterministic scoring ranks the survivors.

Both are virtual namespaces with aliases and collision validation; they differ in *how* a candidate
is chosen. Profile scoring combines the configured-priority component with the health (RI-06),
quota (RI-07), and cost (RI-08) score dimensions where evidence is present; the `latency` weight
folds into the priority share rather than scoring independently. Cost is also enforced through the
`limits.maxEstimatedCostUsd` cap (a candidate whose estimated cost exceeds the cap is excluded).
Per-request route-decision traces are recorded when a policy profile executes.

### Catalog eligibility

A combo remains directly routable even when it cannot be listed. `ocx sync`, `/v1/models`, and the
Codex picker list it only when every target exposes capabilities that can be intersected:

- a positive `contextWindow`, from live metadata, registry hints, or provider
  `modelContextWindows` / `contextWindow`; and
- a non-empty `inputModalities` intersection, treating an omitted member value as `["text"]`.

A bare relay id with no context metadata or targets with disjoint modalities removes the combo from
the catalog. Sync emits a summary warning and the dashboard marks it **Needs attention**. Add context
metadata, align modalities, or target models with discoverable compatible capabilities.

## Request history and routing analytics

- `GET /api/request-history` - cursor-paginated full history from the derived
  index (`routing-history.sqlite`), with filters (`provider`, `model`,
  `requestedModel`, `status`, `conversationId`, `surface`, `inboundProtocol`,
  `apiKeyId`, `profileId`, `fallback`, `from`, `to`) and opaque `cursor`
  pagination. `GET /api/request-history/:requestId` returns one canonical row.
- `GET /api/request-history/:requestId/route-decision` - the why-this-route
  explanation: trace (candidates, exclusions, score components, profile +
  revision), execution attempt sequence, and final outcome.
- `GET /api/routing-analytics` - success/failure/cancelled/fallback rates,
  p50/p95/p99 duration and TTFT, incomplete-stream rate, cooldown-triggering
  failures, cost per successful request, coverage, confidence, and an
  explicit truncation flag.
- `GET /api/routing-profiles`, `POST /api/routing-profiles/dry-run` - profile
  inspection and dry-run evaluation (no upstream dispatch).

Returned history and route-decision payloads expose only masked request metadata
(for example opaque `apiKeyId` labels). They do not include credentials, raw
prompt bodies, or provider secrets.

CLI: `ocx logs explain <request-id>`, `ocx logs rebuild-index`,
`ocx logs index-status`, `ocx route policy list | show | dry-run | evaluate`.

## Migration

`routingProfiles` is optional and additive: existing config files load
unchanged. Old `usage.jsonl` rows without `routeDecision` parse unchanged.
The history index is disposable - deleting `routing-history.sqlite` triggers
an automatic rebuild from `usage.jsonl` on the next query; `ocx logs
rebuild-index` forces one. Nothing in this system auto-tunes weights,
budgets, or candidate sets.

## Provider Split Bridge (planned)

The current 2.10.2 loopback injection sends the built-in Codex `openai` provider to `127.0.0.1:10100`,
where official and third-party models share one process. The planned split mode will send the shared
catalog through an independent `127.0.0.1:10101` bridge:

- native `gpt-*` and account-qualified native rows use the official OpenAI/Codex path;
- explicit `provider/model` rows require the third-party gateway on 10100;
- unknown or ambiguous slugs fail closed;
- gateway failure returns a third-party-only `503 gateway_unavailable` and never falls back to GPT;
- catalog visibility remains stable while gateway readiness is reported separately.

This section describes the target protocol and is not a claim that split mode is active. Activation
requires the separate bridge service, injection journal migration, fake-upstream fault tests, backup,
and an explicit operator gate.
