title: Codex App model picker
description: How opencodex models appear in Codex App, Codex CLI, and Codex TUI through the shared Codex catalog.
---

opencodex does not patch Codex App. It writes the same Codex configuration and model catalog that
Codex CLI/TUI already use. Because Codex App reads that shared state, routed models can appear in the
App's model picker as normal Codex catalog entries.

OpenAI entries use two credential routes: native Codex login and the namespaced
`openai-apikey/<model>` API-key transport. Changing `codexAccountMode` between Pool and Direct by
itself does not change picker ids. When `codexAccountNamespaces` has eligible selectors whose
mapped accounts still exist, however,
opencodex adds separate `<selector>/<native-openai-model>` rows for the mapped accounts and hides
the bare native rows from the Codex picker. Selector labels are user-chosen public names with no
built-in account-role meaning. Selecting a qualified row uses only its mapped account, does not
change the active Pool account, and fails closed instead of switching accounts when the target is
unavailable. In split mode, the selector is preserved to the 10100 exact-account route so the mapped
stored credential is injected there; 10101 never forwards the caller's bearer for that row. See [Exact
Codex account selectors](/reference/configuration/routing/#exact-codex-account-selectors).
API GPT-5.6 entries use
1,050,000 context / 922,000 max input, and `*-pro` picker ids resolve to the base wire model with
`reasoning.mode: "pro"` while logs, usage, and picker state keep the virtual id.
The API catalog is fixed to exactly eight ids: `gpt-5.5`, `gpt-5.6`, Sol/Terra/Luna, and their
three Pro virtual ids; there is no generic `gpt-5.6-pro` alias.
Compact requests keep the selected tier but send the base model without a reasoning object.

Select the credential route represented by the picker id. Change Pool/Direct on the Providers page;
`<selector>` below is a user-chosen public label mapped through `codexAccountNamespaces`:

```text
gpt-5.6-sol                         # bare Codex-login route via Pool or Direct
<selector>/gpt-5.6-sol              # stored Codex account mapped by that selector
openai-apikey/gpt-5.6-sol           # API key
```

Fresh installs and configs with no saved mode default to Pool. Current configs use marker 2 and
retain the shipped v1 source at `~/.opencodex/config.json.pre-openai-tiers-v2.bak`; restore it with:

```sh
cp ~/.opencodex/config.json.pre-openai-tiers-v2.bak ~/.opencodex/config.json
```

Earlier v1 three-provider configurations migrate automatically into the single option-aware row.

## Integration path

`ocx init`, `ocx start`, and `ocx sync` wire the shared Codex config and catalog into the proxy; see
[Codex Integration](/guides/codex-integration/) for config injection, catalog sync, shims, WebSocket
fallback, and restore mechanics.

## Why routed models show up

Codex's model picker expects Codex-shaped catalog entries. opencodex builds routed entries by cloning
a native Codex model template, then replacing the routed model identity:

```text
slug = "anthropic/claude-sonnet-..."
display_name = "anthropic/claude-sonnet-..."
visibility = "list"
```

The clone keeps strict-parser fields such as reasoning levels, shell type, API support flags, and
base instructions. opencodex then removes native-only capabilities that the route cannot honor,
including OpenAI service-tier metadata.

## Current stable model coverage

The native fallback set includes `gpt-5.5`, `gpt-5.4`, `gpt-5.4-mini`,
`gpt-5.3-codex-spark`, and GPT-5.6 Sol/Terra/Luna. For the GPT-5.5/5.4 family, opencodex preserves
the installed Codex catalog's richer live entries and only synthesizes a missing entry. The bundled
upstream snapshot is used only for GPT-5.6, where it supplies the real per-model identity and
metadata instead of an older-template approximation.

| Route | Picker ids and catalog metadata |
| --- | --- |
| Codex login (no eligible account selectors) | Bare native ids such as `gpt-5.6-sol`, `gpt-5.6-terra`, and `gpt-5.6-luna`; Pool or Direct is selected through `codexAccountMode`. GPT-5.6 rows use a 372,000-token catalog window. |
| Codex login (eligible account selectors) | One `<selector>/<native-openai-model>` row per eligible selector and supported native model; each row uses only its mapped account, and bare native rows are hidden from the picker. Native metadata and context windows are preserved. |
| OpenAI (API key) | Exactly eight namespaced rows: `gpt-5.5`, `gpt-5.6`, Sol/Terra/Luna, and the three `*-pro` virtual ids (1,050,000 context; 922,000 max input for all eight) |
| OpenRouter | `openrouter/openai/gpt-5.6-sol`, `openrouter/openai/gpt-5.6-terra`, `openrouter/openai/gpt-5.6-luna` (1,050,000) |
| Cursor | Static fallback includes `cursor/gpt-5.6-sol`, `cursor/gpt-5.6-terra`, and `cursor/gpt-5.6-luna` (1,000,000), plus `cursor/grok-4.5` and `cursor/grok-4.5-fast` (500,000); live account discovery decides which remain visible. |
| xAI | Live discovery is authoritative; the fallback catalog defaults to `xai/grok-4.5` with a 500,000-token window and `low` / `medium` / `high` reasoning controls. |

The pinned GPT-5.6 entries preserve the exact upstream ladder. Sol and Terra expose `low` through
`ultra`; Luna stops at `max`. Sol defaults to `low`, while Terra and Luna default to `medium`.
`ultra` is a client-facing choice for maximum reasoning plus proactive delegation and reaches the
backend as `max`. A picker entry only means the catalog is ready: the connected account or API key
must still be entitled to use that model.

## Native and routed model toggles

The dashboard Models page exposes `disabledModels` toggles for bare native ids and routed
`provider/model` ids. Account-qualified `<selector>/<native-openai-model>` ids are also supported by
`disabledModels`, but the dashboard does not list or toggle those exact selector rows; add them to
the configuration manually:

- Routed ids are namespaced (`provider/model`). Disabling one excludes it from the synced catalog
  and `/v1/models`.
- Account-qualified native ids use `<selector>/<native-openai-model>`. Adding one to
  `disabledModels` hides only that selector row.
- Native GPT ids are bare slugs. Disabling one keeps its catalog entry but changes `visibility` to
  `hide`, preserving the exact entry for a later re-enable; it hides the bare row and every
  selector-qualified clone for that model from discovery.
- Native rows come from the supported static set, so a disabled native model stays visible in the
  dashboard and can be turned back on.

The visibility pass runs after snapshot upgrades, and the management API refreshes the catalog and
forces Codex's model cache stale after a toggle.

## Multi-agent surface mode

The Models-page v1/base/v2 control changes which Codex collaboration surface each picker entry uses;
see [Sub-agent Surface](/guides/sub-agent-surface/) for the canonical mode, delegation, inheritance,
fallback, and encrypted-task behavior.

## Reasoning top tiers

Reasoning-tier visibility is independent of the v1/base/v2 surface mode. Generated reasoning-capable
entries advertise `max` so direct sub-agent effort overrides validate; current generated routed
entries and older native GPT entries also advertise `ultra`. Exact upstream GPT-5.6 ladders are
preserved, so Luna has `max` but no `ultra`.

On the wire, routed adapters map or clamp unsupported tiers. For older native models whose real
ladder stops at `xhigh`, `nativeEffortClamp` maps a direct `max` or an `ultra` selection to `xhigh`
(for example, GPT-5.5). Sol, Terra, and Luna have a real `max` rung.

## Fast tier rules

Codex stores fast mode as:

```toml
service_tier = "fast"

[features]
fast_mode = true
```

But the model catalog and runtime request tier id use `priority`. opencodex preserves that split.
Native OpenAI passthrough models keep fast support; routed providers are capability-gated —
`service_tier` is stripped only when the provider declares `supportsServiceTier: false` (the registry
classifies canonical OpenAI as `true`, DeepSeek and Volcengine Ark as `false`), while unclassified
custom gateways keep caller-supplied values untouched and never get an injection. The fast option is
never advertised where it cannot be honored, and custom gateways can opt in explicitly with `true`.

## Subagent selection

Codex sorts picker-visible catalog entries by ascending `priority` and advertises the first five as
`spawn_agent` model overrides. The dashboard Subagents page can select and save up to five bare
native ids or routed `provider/model` ids. Manually configured `subagentModels` also accepts
account-qualified `<selector>/<native-openai-model>` ids, but the dashboard does not offer those
exact ids; saving the page replaces the list with dashboard-visible choices. opencodex assigns low
catalog priorities in the selected order; when account selectors are active, bare native selections
expand into selector-qualified groups. Other models remain callable by exact id.

The featured-model list is separate from the Dashboard's **Sub-agent delegation** selection. It
controls which overrides Codex offers first; it does not select a model or trigger delegation by
itself.

## Refreshing model state

If the picker still shows stale entries, refresh the catalog and restart the target Codex surface:

```bash
ocx sync
```

opencodex rewrites `models_cache.json` with a deliberately stale cache wrapper whenever catalog
visibility, priority, or metadata changes, so the next Codex model refresh reads the new catalog.

## Provider Split Bridge (activation-gated)

The model picker is a shared catalog surface, not a live gateway-health list. In an activated split
mode, native entries such as `gpt-5.6-luna` and routed entries such as
`deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash` remain visible together. Selecting a native entry uses the official
OpenAI/Codex path; selecting a routed entry uses the local gateway path. If the gateway is down, the
routed row remains selectable but its request fails closed with `gateway_unavailable`; the native row
must remain unaffected. App request success still requires separate HTTP/SSE and WebSocket/app-server
verification, so catalog visibility alone is not a transport compatibility claim. Native WebSocket
upgrades currently use the documented `426` HTTP fallback contract.
