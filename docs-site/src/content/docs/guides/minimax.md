description: Route MiniMax Code and MiniMax CLI text commands through OpenCodex without exposing MiniMax credentials.
---

MiniMax publishes two different command-line products. OpenCodex integrates each at
the protocol boundary it actually exposes:

- **MiniMax Code** (`mcode`) is a coding agent with custom Anthropic Messages providers.
- **MiniMax CLI** (`mmx`) is a multimodal platform CLI. Only its `text` resource speaks
  the Anthropic-compatible API that OpenCodex can route.

## MiniMax Code

Install and sign in to MiniMax Code using MiniMax's instructions first. Then start
OpenCodex and connect the reversible file integration:

```bash
ocx start
ocx integration client enable --client mcode
ocx mcode
```

The integration merges one block into `~/.minimax/config.yaml`:

```yaml
custom_provider:
  opencodex:
    name: OpenCodex
    kind: custom
    enabled: true
    api: anthropic-messages
    options:
      apiKey: opencodex-loopback
      baseURL: http://127.0.0.1:10100
      authMode: api-key
    models:
      anthropic/claude-opus-5: {}
```

The real generated model list comes from the running OpenCodex catalog. The block does
not write a real key, does not replace `defaultModel`, and does not change your MiniMax
login. In MCode, choose a model under `custom_provider:opencodex/...`.

`ocx mcode` verifies that this provider points at the currently running proxy before it
launches the client. If the port changed, refresh the managed block by running the enable
command again. Disable or restore it through the same audited integration system:

```bash
ocx integration client disable --client mcode
ocx integration client history --client mcode
ocx integration client restore --op <opId> [--confirm-drift]
```

`MINIMAX_DATA_DIR` and the legacy `MAVIS_DATA_DIR` are honored. Relative overrides are
refused because OpenCodex and MCode may start in different working directories.

## MiniMax CLI (`mmx`)

Install the official CLI separately:

```bash
npm install -g mmx-cli
mmx --version
```

Route a text command through OpenCodex by using the wrapper and an OpenCodex model id:

```bash
ocx mmx text chat \
  --model anthropic/claude-opus-5 \
  --message "Explain this function"

ocx mmx --output json text chat \
  --model openai/gpt-5.6-sol \
  --message "Return a JSON summary"
```

MMX hard-codes `/anthropic/v1/messages` below its API base URL. The wrapper starts a
temporary loopback bridge for the lifetime of the child process. It accepts only POST
requests to that Messages path and `/anthropic/v1/messages/count_tokens`, mapping them
to OpenCodex's existing `/v1/messages` and `/v1/messages/count_tokens` data plane while
preserving request bodies and query data. Canonical OpenCodex request translation,
usage accounting and configured downstream provider authentication remain in effect;
providers receive `x-api-key` or bearer transport according to their configuration.
Streaming preserves Anthropic message and content events. Before forwarding, the bridge
removes incoming admission credential headers and pins the public
`opencodex-loopback` placeholder. Arbitrary Anthropic resources are not proxied, and
the bridge is never exposed beyond loopback.

The wrapper also creates a temporary `MMX_CONFIG_DIR` containing only that placeholder,
then deletes it after `mmx` exits. Your `~/.mmx/config.json`, OAuth tokens and MiniMax
API key are never loaded or copied.

The following limits are intentional:

- Only `text chat` and `text repl` are routed through OpenCodex.
- `--api-key`, `--base-url` and `--region` are refused by the wrapper so caller
  credentials or destination selectors cannot conflict with the isolated bridge.
- The wrapper is loopback-only because MMX cannot send OpenCodex's dedicated
  `x-opencodex-api-key` admission header for a remote bind.
- Run plain `mmx` for `image`, `video`, `speech`, `music`, `vision`, `search`, `quota`,
  `auth`, `config`, `file` and `update`; those call MiniMax-specific APIs that OpenCodex
  does not emulate.

`mmx` defaults its text model to `MiniMax-M3`. Pass `--model <provider/model>` when you
want a specific OpenCodex route; otherwise normal OpenCodex model routing rules decide
whether the default id is available.
