/**
 * A real second process for the N contention tests.
 *
 * Two processes are the only way to prove cross-process exclusion. A second
 * async task in one isolate shares the SQLite connection cache and the
 * reentrancy store, so it proves neither — and this unit has already shipped a
 * test that looked like a race and was not one.
 *
 * It calls the PRODUCTION module, never a copy, and prints exactly one JSON
 * line so the parent can assert on a typed result rather than on log scraping.
